## Not just letters!

Spell out some words to trigger something special. Which words? See if you can find them. ...or cheat
and look at the source code.

Also try **sums**! Type `1+2=`

## Options

`voice`: Specify which browser voice synthesis voice to use.

The list of voices comes from your chosen browser. Some voice names seem to be web standard, others
not, so it can be fun look in a different browser e.g. this one will work on Chrome but not on safari:

In general Chrome's voice synthesis seems the best. We've also had fun with the "Portuguese" voice
(although keyboard letters is not internationalised when it comes to reading words)

`mode`:
  - `letter-is-for-word` (default) - Read out letter "is for" word e.g. "A is for Apple".
  - `letters` - Just showing letters.
  - `words` - Show and read out words beginning with that letter.

Words and images for those words come from the
[WikiJunior Alphabet book](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Wikijunior:Alphabet) (all open licensed)

`maxlen` - (Secret option only as a URL parameter) Specify a limit to the number of letters on
screen. Hit the limit and they'll start disappering in the background as you type

## Dev notes
Currently it's an all-in-one-file self contained thing (css and javascript inline in the HTML)
which I rather like actually, but if we want to make it more complicated, or if I want to share
logic across several similar "kids" things, then I might end up splitting out the javascript.
